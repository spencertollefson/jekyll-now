title: Getting started with Django
---

Wooo. It's been a little while. Looks like 12 days since my last post when I was working on Cronometer.

The cronometer script I wrote has been refined and works! I use it every morning. Small victories!

It's good to reflect on that, because I have been learning AND struggling the last 12 days. I've put most of my time in learning TDD and the Django framework. I've been going through various tutorials for both of these projects, and I *think* I have learned quite a bit from a theoretical perspective. I've also definitely implemented a bit of what I have learned through tutorials. I thought -- "oh, I'll make a simple blog in Django and maintain my blog there" -- kind of like I currently am doing on Github. But that's feeling a bit overwhelming right now, and I am constantly telling myself I want to get into Panda, Numpy, and these kind of data science tools.

I should do that. This shouldn't be a chore wehn I'm learning on my own, I should really be diving into what I want to do. I did learn a mountain of info about TDD and web dev from the django model. I can always go back to that and pick it up in not too long. But for now, onto what I really want to get into: data science.

Pura Vida!
