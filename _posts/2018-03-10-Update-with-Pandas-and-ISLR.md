title: Update with Pandas and ISLR
---

# Time for another blog post! Quick update of the four main topics I've been focused on for about the last 2 weeks:

**1)** I've been consuming data science and python podcasts like no other. Talk Python to Me, Partially Derivative, Command_line Heroes, CodeNewbie, Data Skeptic, Linear Digressions, Learn to Code with Me, Test & Code, and Python Bytes --- to all those responsible for making those podcasts - THANK YOU! YOU HAVE A FAN IN ME!

**2)** I've worked through about 60% of Jake VanderPlas' **Python Data Science Handbook**. I am working through the Jupyter Notebook version of the book, which has code samples one can interact with. It covers iPython and three widely-used Python data science libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn. I'll be honest here. It's been great at times and a complete slog at others. I've learned a bunch of commands and inputs, and applied them, and fear that I will forget them when I begin working on my own projects. But I think by going through this book I'm going to store a lot of information back deep in my memory, and hopefully later on I'll be able to recall things these libraries can possibly do.

Relatedly, I have been applying some of these tools to my own library. Specifically a "gas log" my dad and I maintained in his 1989 Ford F-150 pickup. The log contains information for every gas fill-up, including date, quantity, price of gas, and location. Once I get going on the matplotlib chapter (soon!) I think I'll have some fun playing with the data then.

**3)** Began reading Introduction to Statistical Learning by authors Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Rob Tibshirani. Am wading into Chapter 4 right now. This is a highly-regarded introduction book to machine learning statistics in the data science community -- and I've found it right at my math and conceptual level so far. Big fan, and I'm hoping I'm able to retain and apply concepts I learn in this book well. The Elements of Statistical Learning may be the next book I tackle.

**4)** I updated my weather.py script to now pull in future information as well! I want to make it a goal to keep refining it.

**5)** I learned quite a bit more about Test Driven-Development (aka writing tests before the code itself), but have yet to implement.

**6)** I learned more about writing secure information in .config files. I have begun implementing into some of my scripts.


*And what have I not focused on?* I haven't been committing in Github, I haven't been working on my own scripts (much), I haven't put any work into creating my own blog (I own the domain name!), and finally not collaborating with others. All of these things feel so important! But I think finishing ISLR and Vanderplas' book will free up time for the above things, and hopefully on some open source work I can use data science tools there.

Pura vida!
