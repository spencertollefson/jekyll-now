title: I made scripts!

#### Scripts. 

I used to hear that word and not know what that meant. Then for years I knew the rough idea, but had no idea how to create one and implement it in a useful fashion. Since really diving into Python and some CS theory a few months back it suddenly seemed comprehensible, yet I still looked the other way instead of attempting to build any of my own. I can finally say this changed. I've lost my scripting virginity.

With only some slight modifications to Al Sweigart's _Automate The Boring Stuff_'s scripts for Google searching and Google Map scripts, I wrote those and got comfortable with those two functions. However, even better that I explored using Git-for-Windows bash, customizing it to my liking, and truly making Google searches, Google Map searches, and even my own script for automating a work form **all automated with a few keystrokes at any time**. It feels AWESOME!

I feel like I discovered some secret treasure. I have a list that I'm adding onto every hour of tasks I can automate, including locally on my machine, on websites I frequently visit, and everywhere inbetween. I'm more excited now about my Python and CS journey than I have been in months. I feel like a lot of the learning I've done in the last few months is kicking in now. Syntax is less confusing and makes more sense. I'm spending less time getting caught in the weeds.

Now I'm spending too much time blogging, not enough time coding. Pura Vida!
