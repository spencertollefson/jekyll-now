title: Automating Daily Cronometer Routine
---

I spent hours, probaby 8 or 9 today, creating an ugly script to automate my Cronometer entry every day. I just finished committing it (I should have made about 5 commits - I made changes and broke things and was a bit frustrated during the process. Good learning point!)

When I get the README up for the repo - hopefully tomorrow - it'll explain what cronometer.com is, how I use it, and what my python script will hopefully save me some time doing every day.

Pura vida!
