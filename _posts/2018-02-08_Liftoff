Welcome reader! Whether I'm addressing myself, as I will probably view this post too many times as I work to setup this blog, or you happen to be another human being, welcome! This is my first blog post here on spencertollefson.github.io, and I hope it's the first of many.

My goals behind this blog begin innocently, but only time will tell to where this expands. I want to journal, chronicle, record, feature, or however else may be described my journey in learning tech. Specifically, I believe right now my posts will be geared toward both of the broad subjects of data science and Python, as well as different tools I use to explore these fields.

As of now, I intend to organize my posts into two sections: a **Musings** section and a **Posts** section. Musings are to be used for shorter entries that tend to highlight whatever has been or was on my mind recently. Perhaps a new tool I tested out, a repo I took a look at, something new I learned during the day. Posts will be reserved for more in-depth entries that perhaps highlight a process I undertook or discuss a deeper data set analysis I went through.

TL;DR: Musings == short and Posts == long.

Until next time, over and out!
